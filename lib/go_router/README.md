# Flutter Page Transitions with GoRouter

Welcome to the Flutter Page Transitions project! This repository contains a comprehensive collection of popular page transitions using the GoRouter package in Flutter. The goal is to provide a reusable codebase that can be easily integrated into any Flutter project, allowing you to switch between different page transitions dynamically using the Riverpod package.

## Features

This project includes the following page transitions:

- **Slide Transitions:**
  - `slideRightToLeft`
  - `slideLeftToRight`
  
- **Size Transitions:**
  - `sizeBottomToTop`
  - `sizeTopToBottom`
  - `sizeLeftToRight`
  - `sizeRightToLeft`
  - `sizeCenterHorizontal`
  - `sizeCenterVertical`

- **Scale Transitions:**
  - `scaleFromBottomCenter`
  - `scaleFromTopCenter`
  - `scaleFromLeftCenter`
  - `scaleFromRightCenter`
  - `scaleFromTopRight`
  - `scaleFromBottomRight`
  - `scaleFromTopLeft`
  - `scaleFromBottomLeft`

- **Fade Transitions:**
  - `fade`
  - `fadeScale`

- **Switcher Transitions:**
  - `switcherVertical`
  - `switcherHorizontal`
  - `switcherScale`

## Dynamic Transition Switching

One of the key features of this project is the ability to change the page transition dynamically at runtime using the Riverpod package. This provides flexibility and enhances the user experience by allowing smooth and varied transitions between pages.
